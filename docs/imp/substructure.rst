After grains have been selected, whole field can be cleared leaving selected grain untouched.

Clicking ``CA -> CA`` button will perform different actions depending of the state of ``Dual phase`` checkbox.

Selected grains will maintain their state but after clearing field they won't increase in size (**Image 7**).
