Summary
=========

Cellular automata method used to simulate grain growth which is important problem in metallurgy. It gives possibility
to simulate with good accuracy the basic grain growth in DP steel. Von Neumann`s and Moore`s growth algorithm gives
very accurate results.

Grain growth is an important matter in metallurgy, microstructure of the material is important to control mechanical
and physical properties.

Cellular automata method chosen for project can give precise results
but the process is pretty time-consuming.
